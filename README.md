# Find your hat

## To start, run commands in terminal:

1. npm install
2. node index.js
3. navigate using WASD keys

### This is a simple terminal game (maze) written with prompt-sync and JS class syntax, with user interaction. The user wins by 'finding' his hat, loses by 'falling' out of the field or stepping into a hole.

#### Have fun!
